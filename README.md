# cquote

just a little c program i wrote that spews quotes out

pro tip: if you run the program over and over again in a short period of time, it tends to give you the same quotes

# compiling

on Linux, just run
```
git clone https://github.com/OtterCodes101/cquote
cd cquote
gcc main.c -o cquote
```
I haven't tested on windows or mac but if you get it to work feel free to open a pr :3
